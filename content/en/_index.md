We are currently developing GGViz, an advanced data visualization
web app that makes it easy for people who work with big data to create
multi-layer, multi-plot, multi-panel (facetted), interactive, and
possibly animated graphics, in order to make
data-driven decisions 
using big data sets and machine learning
algorithms.

GGViz will empower our customers to create new kinds of data
visualizations that are difficult or impossible to create using
existing commercial software (PowerBI/Tableau). The insights our
customers get from their big data will translate into more informed
decision making, and increased value for their business.

## Paid subscriptions coming soon

GGViz is currently in development, and we will soon be inviting users
to alpha test the web app. GGViz will offer free use for public data,
and affordable monthly subscriptions for private data.

## Advantages over other software

### More user-friendly than open-source data viz libraries

GGViz is based on Wilkinson's [Grammar of
Graphics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-28695-0), like
the popular
[ggplot2](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/) in R, and
[plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io) in python.  But unlike
those open-source tools, which are limited to producing static
graphics using a programmatic interface, GGViz will provide an easy to
use point and click interface, able to produce advanced interactive
graphics, similar to our open-source prototype,
[animint2](https://github.com/tdhock/animint2).

### More flexible and interactive than commercial software

Commercial software such as PowerBI and Tableau are inherently limited
to pre-defined chart types, with specific types of interaction and
multi-panel display. In contrast, GGViz users can define a much larger
variety of data visualizations, using our powerful interactive grammar
of graphics. To see the variety of different designs which are
possible, check out the
[animint-gallery](https://rcdata.nau.edu/genomic-ml/animint-gallery/),
which contains 50+ advanced examples which were produced using our
open-source prototype of GGViz,
[animint2](https://github.com/tdhock/animint2).
